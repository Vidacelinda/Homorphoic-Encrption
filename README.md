Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows cloud servers to operate on encrypted text without having to decrypt it. It is the process of applying computations directly on encrypted text, also known as cipher text, to create a new encrypted text. The result is the same as the result of performing the operations on the decrypted data, known as plaintext.  The owner receives the result and the privacy of the data is preserved. There are three levels of homomorphic encryption.  

Fully homomorphic encryption is robust as it can use any number of operations which is why it’s the most researched and popular. 

Somewhat homomorphic encryption uses two operations, but the operations are limited.  

Partially homomorphic encryption uses either the addition or multiplication operation. Though this kind of encryption has limitations, it is easy to design.  

 

However, the computational overhead associated with HE has been a significant deterrent to its practical implementation. This is why innovative solutions like this are being pushed to mitigate this drawback. We want to harness the potential of HE for practical use, especially in machine learning applications, by exploring hardware acceleration and optimizing encryption techniques to address the computational challenges inherent in HE.
